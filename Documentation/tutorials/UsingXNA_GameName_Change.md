# Changing the Name of your Game

By default, the game's name that is displayed on a Windows Phone device is the same as the name of the XNA Game Studio solution.

### To change the game name

1.  Open an XNA Framework game or library project in XNA Game Studio.
2.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the game project node, and then select **Properties**.
3.  In the **Properties** property sheet, click the **Application** tab.
4.  Click **Assembly Information**.
5.  Change the value in the **Title** box to the new name.
6.  Click OK.

An alternative method is to open the AssemblyInfo.cs file in the **Properties** folder of the game project for editing, and then change the value of AssemblyTitle.
