This topic describes the XNA Game Studio project versions supported by Windows Phone SDK 8.0 Extensions for XNA Game Studio 4.0.

Windows Phone SDK 8.0 Extensions for XNA Game Studio 4.0, installed as part of Microsoft Windows Phone SDK 8.0, supports a single project version, targeting Windows Phone 7.1. This is the same version supported by Microsoft Windows Phone SDK 7.1 when Windows Phone 7.1 is chosen as the **Target Windows Phone Version** in the **New Project Options** dialog box. This means that a Windows Phone 7.1 project created with either one of these Windows Phone SDKs can be opened using the other SDK without modification.

If you want to open an XNA Game Studio project created with an older version of XNA Game Studio, or an XNA Game Studio project that targets an older version of Windows Phone, you will have to begin by upgrading the project to target Windows Phone 7.1 using the Microsoft Windows Phone SDK 7.1.

Microsoft Visual Studio projects for Windows or Xbox 360 games or game libraries created with a previous version of XNA Game Studio cannot be opened with Windows Phone SDK 8.0 Extensions for XNA Game Studio 4.0. To continue working with those projects, you should continue using the versions of XNA Game Studio and Microsoft Visual Studio with which the project was created, potentially in a side-by-side installation with Windows Phone SDK 8.0 Extensions for XNA Game Studio 4.0.
