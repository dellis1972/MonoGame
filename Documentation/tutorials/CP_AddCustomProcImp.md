# Adding a Custom Importer

MonoGame provides standard importers and processors for a number of common file formats used to store such basic game assets as models, materials effects, sprites, textures, and so on. For a list of file formats supported by these standard importers and processors, see [Standard Content Importers and Content Processors](CP_StdImpsProcs.md).

### To add a custom importer or processor to a game project

This procedure assumes you have copied the new importer or processor to a local folder in the game project.

1.  Open the MonoGame Pipeline Tool.
2.  Load the .mgcb files associated with your game.
3.  Click on the Content node and in the Properties panel click on References.
4.  Click the Add Button.
5.  Navigate to the directory containing the assembly with the custom importer or processor, and then add it.
5.  Save.

The new importer or processor now appears as a choice in [using dialog properties](UsingXNA_Dlg_Properties.md) for importing or processing a newly added game asset.
