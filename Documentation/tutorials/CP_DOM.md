# Content Pipeline Document Object Model

The MonoGame Content Document Object Model (DOM) represents the set of built-in classes that can be consumed by standard content processors.

Currently, the DOM provides support for meshes, materials, textures, sprite-fonts, and animations. Outside of these, a custom importer can return a [ContentItem](T_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_Content_Pipeline_ContentItem.md) with custom information in its opaque data, or a custom type you have developed.

The following diagram lists the complete Content DOM.
