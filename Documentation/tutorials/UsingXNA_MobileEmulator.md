# Using the Windows Phone Emulator

The Windows Phone Emulator is a software version of the Windows Phone environment that is part of the Microsoft Windows Phone SDK. It is used as a deployment and debugging platform for all types of Windows Phone applications, including Windows Phone games developed using XNA Game Studio. It is especially useful during early development, before you are ready to try running your game on one or more physical Windows Phone devices.
