# Transformations and Collision Testing

Provides classes and methods for manipulating vectors and matrices. This section discusses math and includes examples of common math-related game tasks.

# In This Section

[Positioning the Camera](Math_HowTo_FitCameraToScene.md)

Demonstrates how to position the camera so that all objects in a scene are within the view frustum while maintaining the camera's original orientation.

[Transforming a Point](Math_HowTo_TransformPoint.md)

This example demonstrates how to use the [Vector3](T_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_Vector3.md) and [Matrix](T_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_Matrix.md) classes to transform a point. A matrix transform can include scaling, rotating, and translating information.

[Rotating and Moving the Camera](Math_HowTo_RotateMoveCamera.md)

Demonstrates how to rotate and move a camera in a 3D environment.

[Moving the Camera on a Curve](Math_HowTo_ScriptedCamera.md)

Demonstrates how to use the [Curve](T_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_Curve.md) and [CurveKey](T_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_CurveKey.md) classes to move a camera along the shape of a curve.

[Selecting an Object in 3D Space](Math_HowTo_DetectClicked3DObject.md)

Demonstrates how to check whether the mouse (or touch location) is positioned over a 3D object by creating a ray starting at the camera's near clipping plane and ending at its far clipping plane.

[Bounding Volumes and Collisions](Math_CollisionDetectionOverview.md)

Collision detection determines whether objects in a game world overlap each other.

[Testing for Collisions](Math_HowTo_DetectTwoObjectsColliding.md)

Demonstrates how to use the [BoundingSphere](T_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_BoundingSphere.md) class to check whether two models are colliding.
