These articles provide a brief introduction into graphics pipeline functionality.

[What Is Antialiasing?](WhatIs_Antialiasing.md)

Antialiasing is a technique for softening or blurring sharp edges so they appear less jagged when rendered.

[What Is a Back Buffer?](WhatIs_BackBuffer.md)

A back buffer is a render target whose contents will be sent to the device when [GraphicsDevice.Present](O_M_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_Graphics_GraphicsDevice_Present.md) is called.

[What Is Blend State?](WhatIs_BlendState.md)

Blend state controls how color and alpha values are blended when combining rendered data with existing render target data.

[What Is Color Blending?](WhatIs_ColorBlending.md)

Color blending mixes two colors together to produce a third color.

[What Is a Configurable Effect?](WhatIs_ConfigurableEffect.md)

A configurable effect is an optimized rendering effect designed for Windows Phone. A configurable effect is created using a built-in object with options for user configuration.

[What Is a Depth Buffer?](WhatIs_DepthBuffer.md)

A depth buffer contains per-pixel floating-point data for the z depth of each pixel rendered. A depth buffer may also contain stencil data which can be used to do more complex rendering such as simple shadows or outlines.

[What Is Depth Stencil State?](WhatIs_DepthStencilState.md)

Depth stencil state controls how the depth buffer and the stencil buffer are used.

[What Is a Model Bone?](WhatIs_ModelBone.md)

A model bone is a matrix that represents the position of a mesh as it relates to other meshes in a 3D model.

[What Is a Profile?](WhatIs_Profile.md)

Provides conceptual information about the XNA Game Studio concept of profiles, including explanations of the Reach and HiDef profiles.

[What Is Rasterizer State?](WhatIs_Rasterizer.md)

Rasterizer state determines how to render 3D data such as position, color, and texture onto a 2D surface.

[What Is a Render Target?](WhatIs_Render_Target.md)

A render target is a memory buffer for rendering pixels. One common use for a render target is offscreen rendering.

[What Is Sampler State?](WhatIs_Sampler.md)

Sampler state determines how texture data is sampled using texture addressing modes, filtering, and level of detail.

[What Is a Stencil Buffer?](WhatIs_StencilBuffer.md)

A stencil buffer contains per-pixel integer data which is used to add more control over which pixels are rendered. A stencil buffer can also be used in combination with a depth buffer to do more complex rendering such as simple shadows or outlines.

[What are Vectors, Matrices, and Quaternions?](Math_XNA.md)

Presents an overview of the math-related functionality provided by the XNA Framework.

[What Is a View Frustum?](WhatIs_ViewFrustum.md)

A view frustum is a 3D volume that defines how models are projected from camera space to projection space. Objects must be positioned within the 3D volume to be visible.

[What Is a Viewport?](WhatIs_Viewport.md)

A viewport is a 2D rectangle that defines the size of the rendering surface onto which a 3D scene is projected.
