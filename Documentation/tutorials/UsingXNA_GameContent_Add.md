# How to: Add a Game Content Project

When initially created, an XNA Game Studio solution contains a single content project to contain game assets to be managed through the Content Pipeline. It may be convenient to create and maintain additional content projects, perhaps to manage differing types or collections of content.

### To add a new content project

1.  Open an XNA Framework game or library project in XNA Game Studio.
2.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the root solution node or any blank area.
3.  Click **Add**, and then click **New Project**.
4.  In the **Add New Project** dialog box, click **Empty Content Project**, and then enter the name for the new content project.

### To add an existing content project

1.  Open an XNA Framework game or library project in XNA Game Studio.
2.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the root solution node or any blank area.
3.  Click **Add**, and then click **Existing Project**.
4.  In the file selection dialog box, navigate to the existing content project file, and then select it and click **Open**.

### To remove a content project

1.  Open an XNA Framework game or library project in XNA Game Studio.
2.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the game content project.
3.  Click **Remove**.

For assets your content project will use in the game, you must add references to the content project in the game projects that will use them. The procedure to add content references is described in the topic [Game Content References](UsingXNA_GameContentReference.md).
