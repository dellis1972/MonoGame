This section contains articles describing how to add networking and multiplayer support to Windows Phone games with XNA Game Studio.

On Windows Phone, the following types of networking are supported for XNA Game Studio titles:

*   Xbox LIVE access through Gamer Services. This is available only to developers who have registered with Microsoft for Xbox LIVE on Windows Phone access. For more information about becoming a registered Xbox LIVE on Windows Phone developer, go to [developer.windowsphone.com](http://developer.windowsphone.com).
    
*   Web requests using the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP). This is available to all applications on Windows Phone.
    
*   Push notifications. Push notifications are also implemented through HTTP (client and server) and are available to all applications on Windows Phone.
    

For detailed information about networking and Web services for games, see [Networking and Web Services for Windows Phone](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254758) in the Windows Phone documentation.
