# About Windows Phone SDK 8.0 Extensions for XNA Game Studio 4.0

Windows Phone SDK 8.0 Extensions for XNA Game Studio 4.0 provides a set of libraries and tools to build games and interactive applications for Windows Phone built on the Microsoft .NET Framework in C# or Visual Basic.

In this release, XNA Game Studio is a Microsoft Visual Studio add-in dedicated to Windows Phone development. This is in contrast to previous versions of XNA Game Studio, which provided a relatively easy way to develop games for Xbox 360, Windows, and Windows Phone.

Most of the changes in this release of XNA Game Studio concern the removal of functionality (project templates, choices in the user interface, and so on) and documentation that is not relevant to the creation of games and other interactive applications for Windows Phone, allowing Windows Phone development to be even more straightforward than in previous releases.

The topics in this section provide information about the system requirements and installation of Windows Phone SDK 8.0 Extensions for XNA Game Studio 4.0.
