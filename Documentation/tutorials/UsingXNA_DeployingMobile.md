# Deploying a Windows Phone Game

In the course of developing your Windows Phone game, sometimes you will want to launch your game in the context of the Microsoft Visual Studio debugger. Other times you will want to try running your game outside the context of the debugger, coming closer to the manner in which your users will experience your game on their Windows Phone devices. This process is known as deploying your game.

You can deploy your Windows Phone game to either the Windows Phone Emulator or to a physical Windows Phone device. Assuming that your development hardware is compatible with the Windows Phone Emulator, you will probably begin development using it, and then later, confirm that your game is running as expected on one or more physical Windows Phone devices.

The process of deploying a Windows Phone game, whether to the Windows Phone Emulator or to a physical Windows Phone device, is the same as for any other Windows Phone application. For more information, see [How to: Build and Deploy a Windows Phone Application Using Visual Studio](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254754) in the Windows Phone documentation.
